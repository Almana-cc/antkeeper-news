## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. Job Queue System for Long-Running Tasks

**Problem:**
- Current cron job takes several minutes
- Vercel has 10s execution limit on Hobby, 60s on Pro
- AI processing will make this worse
- Scraping, duplicate detection, tag generation are slow operations

**Options to Consider:**

#### Option A: Trigger.dev (Recommended)
- **Pros:** Built for long-running jobs, generous free tier, good DX, integrates with Vercel
- **Cons:** Another service to manage
- **Use Case:** Perfect for AI processing, scraping, duplicate detection

#### Option B: Inngest
- **Pros:** Similar to Trigger.dev, event-driven, good for workflows
- **Cons:** Learning curve
- **Use Case:** Complex multi-step workflows

#### Option C: BullMQ + Redis (Self-hosted)
- **Pros:** Full control, open source
- **Cons:** Need to host Redis, more complex setup
- **Use Case:** If you want infrastructure control

#### Option D: Separate Worker Server (Railway/Render)
- **Pros:** Simple, just a long-running Node process
- **Cons:** Need to manage server, not serverless
- **Use Case:** If you prefer traditional server architecture

**Recommendation:** Start with **Trigger.dev** - it's designed for exactly this use case and has excellent Vercel integration.

/en                  → English
/es                  → Spanish
/de                  → German
/en/articles         → English articles
```

- **Pros:** Official Nuxt solution, SEO-friendly URLs, auto-detects user language
- **Cons:** Need to translate all UI strings
- **Effort:** Medium - need translation files for each language

#### Option B: Subdomain Strategy
```
www.antkeeper.com    → French
en.antkeeper.com     → English
es.antkeeper.com     → Spanish
de.antkeeper.com     → German
```

- **Pros:** Clean separation, easy CDN config
- **Cons:** More complex deployment, separate builds
- **Effort:** High

**Recommendation:** **Nuxt I18n** - better SEO, simpler to maintain, standard approach.

**News Feed Logic:**
- Site language = default news filter
- User can override (e.g., French site user can view English articles)
- Mobile app API can request specific language via query param
