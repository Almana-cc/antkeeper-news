# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks learnings and progress across iterations.
Each iteration appends new entries - NEVER delete or replace existing content.

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-11T12:00:00Z
### Completed: US-001 - Fix related articles showing duplicates
### Implementation:
- Modified `server/api/articles/[slug]/related.get.ts`
- Added query to `articleDuplicates` table to find all duplicate relationships for the current article
- Excluded all duplicate article IDs (both canonical and duplicate) from related articles query
- Added slug-based deduplication as a safety net filter
### Learnings:
- The project uses `hub:db` for database imports, which auto-resolves to local utils
- No `typecheck` npm script - use `pnpm build` which includes type checking
- No `lint` npm script - use `pnpm eslint <file>` directly
- Branch `ralph/fixes-and-search` was checked out in another worktree, working on `ralph/amp` instead
### Next Priority: US-002
